# Song Guru

Current capabilities:
* Create a way to analyze twitter posts from a number of song recommendation accounts (done)
* Compare most popular songs across these accounts to find songs that are universally agreed upon to be new "hits" (done)
* post these songs on a twitter bot account through Tweepy API (see https://twitter.com/MusicGuru15 )
* save the best <n> songs to a user's spotify account programmatically

Future goals: 
* Use beatiful soup to incorporate information from various webpages in with the data gained from tweets
* Incorporate other pieces of information to aid in more accurate music searches through the Spotify API
