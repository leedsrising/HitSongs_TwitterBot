# HitSongs_TwitterBot

Goals of this project:
* Create a way to analyze twitter posts from a number of song recommendation accounts (done)
* Compare most popular songs across these accounts to find songs that are universally agreed upon to be new "hits" (done)
* post these songs on a twitter bot account through Tweepy API (see https://twitter.com/MusicGuru15 )
* add a way for the best n songs to be added to a users spotify account programmatically
