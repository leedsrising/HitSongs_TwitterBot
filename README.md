# HitSongs_TwitterBot

Goals of this project:
* Create a way to analyze twitter posts from a number of song recommendation accounts
* Compare most popular songs across these accounts to find songs that are universally agreed upon to be new "hits"
* post these songs on a twitter bot account through Tweepy API
